# NPlug.Proxy

This package provides a native proxy for NPlug deployed when not using NativeAOT or when using the NPlug.Validator for Unit tests. It does not contain managed assemblies.

This package is not meant to be used directly but is referenced internally by NPlug and NPlug.Validator.

See the GitHub repository for more information.
